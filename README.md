# AdBlock-Classic
An open-source adblocker for K-Meleon.

AdBlock Classic is an extension for the lightweight browser K-Meleon. AdBlock Classic includes an updated and de-branded descendant of the classic AdBlock Plus extension for Firefox. It also includes macros that tie into K-Meleon's interface. It can use AdBlock Plus filters and [rules](https://adblockplus.org/filter-cheatsheet) (including AdBlock Locus's Fallback subscription). The package is open-source software available under the MPL 2.0. AdBlock Classic is distributed freely, as-is, and without warranty. That said, you're welcome [visit the K-Meleon forums if you have questions or issues](http://kmeleonbrowser.org/forum/read.php?19,155958).
